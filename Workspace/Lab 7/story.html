        Anthropocene
    </h1>
    <main> 
        Steel droplets descend the fibers of a leaf,
        <br>True air has left us.
        <br>Natural become unnatural, and unnatural 
        <br>accepted as norm.
        <br>Our devices have lead us to the forefront 
        <br>of human capability.
        <br>At what cost, do we examine this fervent
        <br>effort to complexify our lives?
        <br>Air tangible, but not a product of tension.
        <br>For we poison our skies and headspace with
        <br>byproducts of tempory bliss concentrated in
        <br>disposable forms.
        <br>How to break the cycle; how to restore the world.
        <br>Our waters, acidified. Our air made polluted.
        <br>Our values, perverted. Our lives made polluted.
        <br>And yet, we advance.
        <br>The drive to conquer; man must own all, be masters of all, exploit all.
        <br>Our anthropocene brethren will be the end of us.
        <br>Steel droplets descend the folds of our skin.
        <br>True humans have left us.
        <br>Their values permeate yet; for all hope is not lost.
        <br>It is up to us, the inheritors of their destiny, to
        <br>fulfill our purpose.
        <br>To embody their pursuit of ideals, and all that is
        <br>good.
